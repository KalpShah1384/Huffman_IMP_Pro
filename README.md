# Huffman Coding for File Encryption and Decryption
This repository contains an implementation of Huffman coding for file compression (which can be used for a basic form of encryption by making the compressed file unreadable without the decoding tree). It provides functionality for both encoding (compressing) and decoding (decompressing) files.
# Huffman_IMP_Pro
Huffman coding is a variable-length prefix coding scheme used for lossless data compression. It works by assigning shorter codes to more frequent characters and longer codes to less frequent characters. This results in a smaller average code length and thus, compression.
# Features:-
Compression , Decompression , Efficiency , Clear output and Error Handling.
# Algorithm:- Huffman Coding
